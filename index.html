      <h2>Who are annuities for?</h2>
      <p>Annuities are a great product for risk management within your portfolio. Funds that are in an annuity contract are guaranteed to be protected from market losses and the interest credited from an annuity is not tied to stock market gains. This is a particulary attractive option for individuals who are 59 and a half or older because annuities continue to defer the taxes on gains that were created inside of qualified plans.</p>

      <h2>What do I need to know about life insurance?</h2>
      <p>Life insurance is an valuable tool for protecting your loved ones in the event of your untimely death. Most people use life insurance to replace income or to prepare for expenses. Death benefit protection from life insurance can be allowed to replace decades worth of income in the event of an untimely passing. In addition to death benefit protection, a permament life insurance contract can be prepaid and the owner can earn interest on the prepayment. A life insurance policy is is typically a good idea for individuals who are ages 25-65 and that have financial obligations that would need to be taken care of if they passed away.</ul>

      <h2>Are there options for businesses?</h2>
	 <p>Businesses also use life insurance to protect the continuation of a business. Partners in a business will often purchase life insurance policies on eachother to create a buy-sell agreement that will fund the surviving partners purchase of the deceased partners shares. A business may also choose to use permament life insurance to create an executive bonus plan for their key members. Depending on what is in a bussinesses financial portfolio, a business may diversify their riskier assets into an annuity to create more long-term stability. We recommend consulting with an independent life insurance agent before purchasing a life insurance policy or annuity for your business.</ul>
