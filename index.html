      <h2>What do I need to know about life insurance?</h2>
      <p>Life insurance is for protecting your family or business when you pass away. Term life insurance provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time at an affordable price. Conversion privelges are often added to term policies that allow them to be converted into permanent policies without evidence of insurability. The proceeds from a death benefit are tax free and can be used however the beneficiary chooses. Permanent life insurance can accumulate cash value that can be used for emergencies, supplementing income, and funding a major purchase. If strucutred correctly, permanent insurance can have a lower net cost than term insurance over the lifetime of the policy. Life insurance, either term or permament, is a necassary compenent for optimal finanical health. </ul>
