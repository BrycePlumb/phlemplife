     <p>A single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) offers a locked in interest rate for life or a certain period of time. This is best if you want to pay with a lump sum from your savings or retirement plan and begin earning interest immediately.</p>

     <p>A fixed indexed annuity (FIA) offers an interest rate tied to the changes in an index. With a FIA, you are protected from market losses because there is a minimum interest rate.<sup>1</sup> This is a great option if you want to pay with a lump sum or series of payments and you may defer your payments until later.<sup>2</sup></p>

     <p>A multi year guarantee annuity (MYGA) offers a competitve interest rate for a specific number of years, usually 3, 5, or 7 years. This is a good option if you like the benefits of the SPIA, but only want payments to last for a specific period of time.</p>

	<p>The term financial professional is not intended to imply engagement in an advisory business in which compensation is not related to sales. Financial professionals that are insurance licensed will be paid a commission on the sale of an insurance product.</p>
        <p>1. Fixed index annuities are not a direct investment in the stock market. They are long term insurance products with guarantees backed by the issuing company. They provide the potential for interest to be credited based in part on the performance of specific indices, without the risk of loss of premium due to market downturns or fluctuation. Although fixed index annuities guarantee no loss of premium due to market downturns, deductions from your accumulation value for additional optional benefit riders or strategy fees associated with allocations to enhanced crediting methods could exceed interest credited to the accumulation value, which would result in loss of premium. They may not be appropriate for all clients. Interest credits to a fixed index annuity will not mirror the actual performance of the relevant index.</p>
	<p>2. Withdrawals taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to IRS penalties.</p>
