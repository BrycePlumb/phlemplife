     <p>The single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) has a locked in interest rate for life or a certain period of time. Pyaments from an SPIA begin immediately after the annuity is purchased with a lump sum amount from a savings or retirment plan. There is also a Single Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA), that allows the owner of the annuity to defer the payments they will receive until a later date. The interest on both types of annuities is credited by an insurance company with an interest rate set at the time of purchase.</p>

     <p>The interest rate of a fixed indexed annuity (FIA) is tied to the changes in an index. There is protection from market losses because the interest credited is not tied to stock market gains.<sup>1</sup> The annuity owner can pay with a lump sum or series of payments and they also choose whether to defer the payments until a later date or begin receiving payments immediately. There is protection from market losses because the interest credited is not tied to stock market gains and is credited by an insurance company.<sup>2</sup></p>

     <p>For a multi year guarantee annuity (MYGA) the insurance company pays a guaranteed interest rate for a specific number of years, usually 3, 5, or 7 years. The annuity owner starts to receive payments for a specific period of time after purchasing the annuity with a lump sum payment.</p>

	<p>The term financial professional is not intended to imply engagement in an advisory business in which compensation is not related to sales. Financial professionals that are insurance licensed will be paid a commission on the sale of an insurance product.</p>
        <p>1. Fixed index annuities are not a direct investment in the stock market. They are long term insurance products with guarantees backed by the issuing company. They provide the potential for interest to be credited based in part on the performance of specific indices, without the risk of loss of premium due to market downturns or fluctuation. Although fixed index annuities guarantee no loss of premium due to market downturns, deductions from your accumulation value for additional optional benefit riders or strategy fees associated with allocations to enhanced crediting methods could exceed interest credited to the accumulation value, which would result in loss of premium. They may not be appropriate for all clients. Interest credits to a fixed index annuity will not mirror the actual performance of the relevant index.</p>
	<p>2. Withdrawals taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to IRS penalties.</p>
