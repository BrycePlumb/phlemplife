  <h2>Single Premium Immediate Annuity: Buy a Stream of Income</h2>
  <img src="SPIA-line.png" alt="Single Premium Immediate Annuity Line Logo" class="SPIA-image"> 
  <p>The <strong>Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA)</strong> is a type of annuity that offers a <strong>locked-in interest rate</strong> for either a specified period of time or for life. Payments from an SPIA begin immediately after a <strong>lump sum payment</strong> from a savings or retirement plan is made. 
  There is also a <strong>Single Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA)</strong>, which allows the annuity owner to defer payments until a later date. 
  Both SPIA and SPDA interest is credited by an insurance company with an interest rate set at the time of purchase.</p>

  <h2>Fixed Indexed Annuity: Stream of Income Linked to the Changes in an Index</h2>
  <img src="FIA-line.png" alt="Fixed Indexed Annuity Line Logo" class="FIA-image"> 
  <p>A <strong>Fixed Indexed Annuity (FIA)</strong> is a type of annuity where the interest rate is linked to the performance of a financial index. With an FIA, there is protection from <strong>market losses</strong> as any interest credited is not tied to stock market gains. <sup>1</sup> 
  FIA owners can choose to make a <strong>lump sum payment</strong> or a series of payments and decide whether to <strong>defer payments</strong> or begin receiving payments immediately. The interest is credited by an insurance company and is not tied to stock market gains, providing additional protection from market losses.<sup>2</sup></p>

  <img src="MYGA-line.png" alt="Multi-Year Guarantee Annuity Line Logo" class="MYGA-image"> 
  <p>A <strong>Multi-Year Guarantee Annuity (MYGA)</strong> is a type of <strong>fixed term annuity</strong> where the insurance company guarantees to pay a fixed interest rate for a specific number of years, typically 3, 5, or 7 years. After purchasing the annuity with a <strong>lump sum payment</strong>, the annuity owner starts to receive payments for a specified period of time. MYGAs provide a guaranteed source of income for a set period of time.<img src="MYGA-square.jpg" alt="MYGA Text" class="MYGA-square"></p>

	<p>The term financial professional is not intended to imply engagement in an advisory business in which compensation is not related to sales. Financial professionals that are insurance licensed will be paid a commission on the sale of an insurance product.</p>
        <p>1. Fixed index annuities are not a direct investment in the stock market. They are long term insurance products with guarantees backed by the issuing company. They provide the potential for interest to be credited based in part on the performance of specific indices, without the risk of loss of premium due to market downturns or fluctuation. Although fixed index annuities guarantee no loss of premium due to market downturns, deductions from your accumulation value for additional optional benefit riders or strategy fees associated with allocations to enhanced crediting methods could exceed interest credited to the accumulation value, which would result in loss of premium. They may not be appropriate for all clients. Interest credits to a fixed index annuity will not mirror the actual performance of the relevant index.</p>
	<p>2. Withdrawals taken prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to IRS penalties.</p>
