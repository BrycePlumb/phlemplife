	   <p class="Texas">Texas Residents: Receipt of acceleration-of-life-insurance benefits may affect your, your spouse’s or your family’s eligibility for public assistance programs such as medical assistance (Medicaid), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), supplementary social security income (SSI), and drug assistance programs. You are advised to consult with a qualified tax advisor and with social service agencies concerning how receipt of such a payment will affect your, your spouse’s and your family’s eligibility for public assistance.</p>
	   <p>1. This is not meant to be viewed as legal or tax advice. Consult with your qualified tax professional or attorney in regards to such matters.</p>
	   <p>2. Accelerated death benefits (Living benefits) are subject to eligibility requirements.</p>
	   <p>3. The tax-deferred feature of an indexed universal life policy is not necessary for a tax-qualified plan. In such instances, you should consider whether other features, such as the death benefit and optional riders make the policy appropriate for your needs. Before purchasing a policy, you should obtain competent tax advice both as to the tax treatment of the policy and the suitability of the product.</p>
