      <h1>Life Insurance</h1>
      <p>
        Life insurance will protect your family or business when you pass away. The beneficary chosen receives a death benefit tax-free, creating a financial safety net that can be used for funeral costs,
        outstanding debts, and ongoing expenses for your family and business.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Life Insurance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
       Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific term, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. This financial protection is typically used for a specific period of time, such as when a person is raising a family, paying off a mortgage, or supporting dependents.
When purchasing term life insurance, the policyholder chooses the term length, the face amount, and the payment frequency. Term life insurance premiums are much lower than permament life insurance premiums, making it more affordable.
Some term life insurance policies come with conversion priveleges that a policy owner can use to convert a term policy into a permanent policy. In some cases, the policyholder can convert the policy without the insured going through underwriting again.
Term life insurance is a good idea for families and businesses that can't afford to lose one of their members and want an affordable protection plan.

Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides lifetime death benefit protection. When the insured dies, a tax-free death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary they chose.
 Whole life insurance has a higher upfront cost than term insurance but it can have a lower net cost if strucutred properly because of cash value accumlation. A policy owner can prepay their contract
   up to the limits of section 7702(a) in the internal revenue code and earn interest tax-deffered on the prepaid amount known as cash value. This policy is a great option to prepare for general final expenses such as funeral costs, debts, and taxes.

        <li>
          Indexed Universal Life Insurance (IUL) is permanent life insurance with lifelong coverage and flexible premiums. Similar to whole life insurance, an IUL can also be prepaid with interest credited on the prepaid amount that is not subject to surrender charges.
          Cash value in an IUL is credited interest linked to the performance of select indexes and has a minimum gurantee built in. IUL premiums are strucutured differently than whole life premiums and this allows for higher funding limits. 
          An IUL is best for individuals and businesses who are seeking permament protection with flexible premiums, higher funding limits in their policy, and interest credited linked to the performance of an index like the S&P 500.
